# Hi there, I'm the Frontend Wizard! 👋🧙‍♂️

Welcome to my digital garden, where I plant code and grow applications! 🌱👨‍💻

🎯 **Who am I?**
I'm not just a Frontend Developer skilled in conjuring spells with React, Vue.js, Node.js, GraphQL, and TypeScript; I'm also a former math teacher who traded in my calculator for a keyboard. Now, I weave magical web experiences and aim to join an agile coven... I mean, company, where I can cast my creativity into real-world solutions.

🔍 **Curiosity Chronicles:**
Once a humble math teacher, curiosity enchanted me and transformed my path toward the arcane arts of coding. I began my journey as a Software Developer, and now I spend my days crafting spells in JavaScript and defending the realm of digital interfaces.

🌟 **Volunteer Ventures:**
I lend my powers to community tech projects, helping fellow adventurers level up in this mystical tech landscape.

🌿 **Life Beyond the Screen:**
When I’m not battling bugs or summoning server-side spirits, you can find me in the tranquility of my garden, cooking up not potions, but delicious dishes, and tending to my magical herbs.

🛠 **Technological Toolkit:**
- **Spellbooks and Wands:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, Next.js
- **Potions and Elixirs:** Node.js, NestJs, AWS, Git, SQL
- **Enchantments:** REST APIs, GraphQL, Styled Components, Jest

🔗 **Connect with the Wizard:**

💡 **Fun Fact:** I find debugging a less daunting task than defeating dragons! 🐉

### My Interests:
- RESTful APIs, Design Patterns, CI/CD - crafting cleaner code for a better tomorrow!

So, step into my realm and let’s create some magic together! 🌟🚀
